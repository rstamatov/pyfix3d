# Overview
This software allows manual correction of segmentation labels in 2D and 3D images. It was developed specifically for correcting segmentation labels of chromosomes in cell nuclei but can be applied to other areas outside Molecular Biology. 
A detailed user guide will be added here soon, as the related manuscript is currently under review.
